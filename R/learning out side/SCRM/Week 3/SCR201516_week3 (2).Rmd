# Working Strategy

The graduate will be able to recognize gaps in his/her knowledge and to find the resources to fill these


## Working strategy / Time management

- Translate problem into little steps and smaller objects (sometimes without overview)   

- Go for the easy solution first (vectorize later...)   

- Trial and Error / Helpfile first / the Internet

# Chapter 5: | Data frames

## Introduction Data frames

5.1  Creating Data Frames

5.2  Matrix-Like Operations

*5.3  Merging Data Frames (self-study, important too!)*

5.4  Applying functions to Data Frames



## Creating Data Frames
 
Data frames have properties of lists AND matrices... 

```{r, datafr1}
N <- 10
dfram <- data.frame(row.names = 1:N)
dfram$V1 <- c(1:9, NA)
dfram[[2]] <- c(NA, letters[1:9])
dfram[, 3] <- colors()[1:10]
dfram[, "V4"] <- 10:1
str(dfram)  # view structure of dfram
```


## List/Matrix-Like Operations

Which is List-like, which is Matrix-like? 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
class(dfram[["V1"]])
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
class(dfram[, "V1", drop = FALSE])
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
class(dfram[, "V1"])
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
class(dfram["V1"])
```


<!-- twee slides en data weergeven?-->
## Matrix-Like Operations

Would these code chunks work? When would it (not)?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
apply(X = dfram, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
apply(X = dfram, MARGIN = 2, FUN = print)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cbind(dfram, dfram[order(dfram$V4)[-4], ])
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rbind(dfram, dfram)
```


## Matrix-Like Operations

Would these code chunks work? When would it (not)?

```{r, eval = TRUE}
apply(X = dfram, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```


## Matrix-Like Operations

Would these code chunks work? When would it (not)?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
apply(X = dfram, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE}
apply(X = dfram, MARGIN = 2, FUN = print)
```

## Matrix-Like Operations

Would these code chunks work? When would they (not)?

```{r, eval = TRUE}
cbind(dfram, dfram)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE}
rbind(dfram, dfram)
```



## List-Like Operations

How about these implicit loops? 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lapply(X = dfram, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE}
sapply(X = dfram, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```
## Extracting from Data Frames

Within in a 'local' data environment.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
with(data = dfram, expr = (V1 > 3) & (V4 > 3))
```

```{r, eval = TRUE}
subset(x = dfram, subset = V1 > 3 & V4 > 3, select = c(1, 3, 4))
```

## ```stringsAsFactors```
 
Data frames have properties of lists AND matrices... 

```{r, datafr3}
V1 <- c(1:9, NA)
V2 <- c(NA, letters[1:9])
V3 <- colors()[1:10]
V4 <- 10:1
dfram <- data.frame(V1, V2, V3, V4, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(dfram)  # view structure of dfram
```




# Chapter 6: | Factors and Tables

## Factors and Tables

6.1  Factors and Levels

6.2  Common Functions used with Factors

6.3  Working with Tables

6.4  Other Factor and Table-Related functions



## Factors and levels

Factors in R more than only an annoyance? [See Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3445316/factors-in-r-more-than-an-annoyance)

Many cases where strings end up in factors: 
```{r}
dfram <- data.frame(V1, V2, V3, V4)
str(dfram)
```

Also with functions as `read.table` where `StringsAsFactors = TRUE`



## Factors and levels

Main annoyance?

```{r, factlevels1}
xf <- factor(1:5)
str(xf)
xf[6] <- 6
```

Need to set levels again

```{r, factlevels2}
xff <- factor(xf, levels = 1:6)
xff[6] <- 6
```



## Factors and levels

```{r}
IQ <- rnorm(20, 100, 15)
brks <- c(round(min(IQ - 1)), 85, 115, round(max(IQ + 1))) 
catIQ <- cut(x = IQ, breaks = brks, 
             labels = c("L","M","H"),
             include.lowest = TRUE, right = FALSE)
catIQ
str(catIQ)
```


## Tables / Common functions

```{r, tapply}
require(stats)
groups <- as.factor(rbinom(32, n = 5, prob = 0.4))
tab1 <- tapply(groups, groups, length)
tab1
```

Which is almost the same as:
```{r}
tab2 <- table(groups)
```


## Tables / Common functions


```{r}
class(tab1)
class(tab2)
```


## Common function: split

An example from the help file of the function split. We would like to normalize the Ozon variable separately for each month.

Let's do this one together...

```{r}
?airquality
g <- airquality$Month
#class(g)
?split
l <- split(airquality, g)
l <- lapply(X = l, transform, Oz.Z = scale(Ozone))
aq2 <- unsplit(l, g)
with(aq2, tapply(Oz.Z,  Month, sd, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Recap:

- Data Frames

- Factors

- Tables

What are implicit looping functions?

# Chapter 7: | R Programming Structures



## R Programming Structures


7.1  Control Statements

7.2  Arithmetic and Boolean Operators and Values (mostly covered)

Functions:

- 7.3  Default values for Arguments 

- 7.4  Return Values

- 7.5  Functions are objects

- 7.6  Environment and Scope Issues

<!-- 7.7 - 7.10: self study -->




## 7.1 Control statements


- Loops:
  +  `for()`: loop over a sequence of values, e.g., iterations
  +  `while()`: loop as long as a prespecified condition is satisfied
  +  `replicate()`: replicate a number of times

- Control flow:
  +  `if(){}else{}`: standard control flow
  +  `ifelse()`: conditional element selection (vectorized version) 
  +  `switch()`: select one of a list of alternatives (not being discussed)


## 7.1 Three things about for loops

Draw 5 values from a standard normal populations, a for loop example

```{r}
set.seed(20141120)
x <- numeric()
for(i in 1:5){
      x[i] <- rnorm(1)
}
x
```

A side effect is that the variable `i` still exists after the loop has concluded and it has the value of the last element of vector that the loop was evaluated for.



## 7.1 Three remarks about for loops

**1.** Avoid growing objects!! Better write as follows:

```{r}
set.seed(20141120)
x <- numeric(5)
for(i in 1:5){
      x[i] <- rnorm(1)
}
x
```



## 7.1 Three remarks about for for-loops

**2.** if you can use implicit loop functions (`sapply`,`lapply`, `apply`, `rowSums`, `rowMeans`), go for it!

```{r}
set.seed(20141120)
sapply(1:5, function(x) rnorm(1))  # see the implicit loop?
```

**3.** Use the power of Vectorization! (When possible)
```{r}
set.seed(20141120)
rnorm(5)
```

[interesting (more advanced) link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5533246/why-is-apply-method-slower-than-a-for-loop-in-r)

## 7.1 When use for-loop in R?

- When iterations depend upon each other! (See exercises lab meeting 2 and assignment). E.g. this happens in case you need updated objects from previous **iteratons** in the next iteration.

- Also, many times it is easy code to start with before you go to clever programming with vectorization or implicit loops (time management & working strategy).


## 7.1 While and Repeat

```{r}
i <- 1
while (i <= 10) {
    i <- i + 4
}
i
```

```{r}
i <- 1
while (TRUE) {
    i <- i + 4
    if (i > 10) 
        break
}
i
```

## 7.1 While and Repeat

```{r}
i <- 1
while (TRUE) {
    i <- i + 4
    if (i > 10) 
        break
}
i
```


```{r}
i <- 1
repeat {
    i <- i + 4
    if (i > 10) 
        break
}
i
```

## 7.1 While and Repeat

```{r}
i <- 1
repeat{
  i <- i + 4
  if(i > 10) break
  }
i
```

Restrict the number of iterations using a for loop:
```{r}
i <- 1
for (it in 1:10) {
    i <- i + 4
    if (i > 10) 
        break
}
i
```

Could you write a similar while loop also including restrictions?


## 7.1 if-else / ifelse()

`ifelse()`

```{r}
x <- 1:8
y <- ifelse(x%%2 == 1, "odd", "even")
y
```


## 7.1 if-else / ifelse()

if-else, non-vectorized

```{r}
x <- matrix(c(NA, 1:11), 6, 2)
if (any(is.na(x))) {
    x <- t(na.omit(x))
} else {
    x <- t(x)
}
x
```

## 7.1. Checks / Recap

- Three remarks about for-loops?

- Implicit loop vs explicit loop, when?

- When `if(){} else {}` instead of `ifelse()`?


# Functions

7.2-5 Functions

- Default values for Arguments 

- Return Values

- Functions are objects


7.6  Environment and Scope Issues


## 7.2-5 Functions

We have seen:

```{r}
oddcount <- function(x) {
    k <- 0  # assign 0 to k
    for (n in x) {
        if (n%%2 == 1) 
            k <- k + 1
    }
    return(k)
}
```

Here, `function(){}` is a built-in generic ```R``` function.


## Google's R style guide

Let's take a look at the example function in the [Google's  R style guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml)

```{r, Glglexamp, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
CalculateSampleCovariance <- function(x, y, verbose = TRUE) {
  # Computes the sample covariance between two vectors.
  #
  # Args:
  #   x: One of two vectors whose sample covariance is to be calculated.
  #   y: The other vector. x and y must have the same length, greater than one,
  #      with no missing values.
  #   verbose: If TRUE, prints sample covariance; if not, not. Default is TRUE.
  #
  # Returns:
  #   The sample covariance between x and y.
  n <- length(x)
  # Error handling
  if (n <= 1 || n != length(y)) {
    stop("Arguments x and y have different lengths: ",
         length(x), " and ", length(y), ".")
  }
  if (TRUE %in% is.na(x) || TRUE %in% is.na(y)) {
    stop(" Arguments x and y must not have missing values.")
  }
  covariance <- var(x, y)
  if (verbose)
    cat("Covariance = ", round(covariance, 4), ".\n", sep = "")
  return(covariance)
}
```

```{r}
class(CalculateSampleCovariance)
```

## 7.2-5 Functions


```{r}
formals(CalculateSampleCovariance)
```

```{r}
args(CalculateSampleCovariance)
```

## 7.2-5 Functions

```{r}
body(CalculateSampleCovariance)
```


## 7.6 Scope issues

An example of Scope Hiearchy. Let's make the following function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a <- 3
sumab <- function(b) {
    ab <- a + b
    a <- 4
    return(ab)
}
sumab(3)
a
```

## 7.6 Scope issues

`R_GlobalEnv` / *top level*

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ls()
rm(list = ls())
```

Would it be smart to have `rm(list = ls())` as a code chunk in every .Rmd report?



## 7.6 Scope

Remember the code...

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tab1 <- with(aq2, tapply(Oz.Z,  Month, sd, na.rm = TRUE))
```

.... Also a local scope idea.


## 7.2-5 Average up to

\[ \mu_j = j^{-1} \sum^{j}_{i =1} x_i, \qquad \qquad x = \{x_1, \ldots , x_n\}, j = 1 \ldots, n\]

```{r}
AverageUpTo <- function(x, j, na.rm = FALSE) {
    if (na.rm == TRUE) {
        x <- na.omit(x)
    }
    out <- na.fail(j^-1 * sum(x[1:j]))
    return(out)
}
```
